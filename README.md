# NumberSystem
An experimental library to convert numbers to different number systems, especially non-integer ones. What this means is up for you to decide. If you want to use it, take a look at some of the tests.

## Warning
This library currently only uses floating point numbers when dealing with decimals. Keep in mind that the results will not be exact. In the future, support for exact numbers will be added.
